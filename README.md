# DeepSpeed Windows Wheels Collection
Pre-compiled DeepSpeed wheels for Windows - **no build tools required**! üöÄ

Building DeepSpeed from source on Windows is notoriously difficult. These wheels are ready to use.

## üéØ Available Wheels

### DeepSpeed
Distributed training library with ZeRO memory optimization and high-performance kernels.

## üîß Known Limitations

Some DeepSpeed features are disabled on Windows:
- Async I/O operations (Linux-only)
- GPUDirect Storage (Linux-only)
- Some inference ops

Core training features (ZeRO, mixed precision, gradient accumulation) work perfectly!
